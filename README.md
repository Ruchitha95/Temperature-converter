# Temperature-converter

The Temperature Converter program allows users to convert temperatures between different units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This project demonstrates basic input/output handling in C, as well as control flow using conditionals and loops.

Features:
Unit Conversion:
Convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Convert from Celsius to Kelvin.
Convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Convert from Fahrenheit to Kelvin.
Convert from Kelvin to Celsius.
Convert from Kelvin to Fahrenheit.
User Input:
The user is prompted to enter a temperature value and choose the conversion type.
Looping:
The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple conversions until they choose to exit.
Error Handling:
The program handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric entries, invalid temperature values, or invalid conversion choices).
Exit Option:
The program includes an option for users to exit after completing their desired conversions.
Project Breakdown:
Input: The program will ask for the temperature value and the conversion type.
Processing: Based on the user's input, it will apply the appropriate conversion formula.
Formula Examples:
Fahrenheit to Celsius: C = (F - 32) * 5/9
Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (C * 9/5) + 32
Kelvin to Celsius: C = K - 273.15
Celsius to Kelvin: K = C + 273.15
Output: Display the converted temperature value.
